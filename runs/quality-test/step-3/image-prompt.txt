A magnificent greenhouse with arched glass panels showing different seasons simultaneously - some frosted with winter ice, others glowing with summer warmth. Neat rows of clockwork trees with brass leaves that tick rhythmically. A central fountain of liquid mercury flows upward and downward in temporal loops, surrounded by impossible botanical machinery.
