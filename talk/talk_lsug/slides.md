2. Add to conversation history
3. Call LLM with context
4. Process tool calls
5. Update immutable state
6. Return new state

**Speaker Notes:**
Back to SZork - how does the game agent work? It's all about immutable state management. Every action creates a new state, maintaining complete history.

def generate_story(theme, style):
    # Runtime errors possible
```

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Compile-time error prevention
