Through tall windows, impossible gardens shimmer where copper roses bloom in perpetual spring while iron daisies wilt in endless autumn. The entrance hall stretches before you - brass pipes snake across vaulted ceilings like metallic vines, and a reception desk of polished mahogany sits beneath a flickering gas lamp.",
