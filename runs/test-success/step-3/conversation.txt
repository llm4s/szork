[Message 4] ASSISTANT:
You stand on the weathered deck of Captain Redbeard's ship, the Crimson Tide. First Mate Sullivan paces nervously near the mainmast, his weathered hands fidgeting with a length of rope. A wooden hatch in the deck leads down to the hold, while the captain's cabin door stands slightly ajar to the north. Rope rigging stretches up toward the crow's nest, and a gangplank extends east to the dock.
