[Message 4] ASSISTANT:
You examine the entrance hall more carefully. Brass pipes snake across the vaulted ceiling, their aged surfaces telling stories of countless seasons. The mahogany reception desk dominates the space, its drawers slightly ajar as if recently searched. A visitor's logbook lies open on the desk's surface, and the flickering gas lamp casts dancing shadows across faded wallpaper.
