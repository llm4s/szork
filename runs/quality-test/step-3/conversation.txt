look around

[Message 4] ASSISTANT:
You examine the entrance hall more carefully. Brass pipes snake across the vaulted ceiling, their aged surfaces telling stories of countless seasons. The mahogany reception desk dominates the space, its drawers slightly ajar as if recently searched. A visitor's logbook lies open on the desk's surface, and the flickering gas lamp casts dancing shadows across faded wallpaper.

go north

[Message 6] ASSISTANT:
You push through the glass doors into the temporal greenhouse. Glass panels arch overhead, some frosted with winter's touch while others shimmer with summer heat. Clockwork trees grow in neat rows, their brass leaves ticking softly as they photosynthesize light into time itself. A central fountain bubbles with liquid mercury, its flow reversing every few seconds.
