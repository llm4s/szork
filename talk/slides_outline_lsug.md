**Code Generation Example:**
```scala
???
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Watch this - we'll have AI generate a complete Scala tool. Notice the type safety - the AI respects Scala's type system. This isn't just code completion; it's understanding and generating idiomatic Scala."

---

## Slide 11: Image Understanding
**Page Layout:** Before/after comparison

**Visual Specification:**
- Left: Uploaded screenshot/image
- Right: AI-generated description

**Speaker Notes:**
"It's not just about generating images - we can understand them too. Upload any screenshot and watch the AI describe it perfectly. This enables automated UI testing, accessibility tools, document processing..."

---

## Slide 12: Agent Architecture
**Page Layout:** Layered architecture diagram

**Visual Specification:**
- Stack visualization with 4 layers
- State management flow on right
- Immutability indicators (lock icons)
- Code snippets for each layer

**Agent Components:**
| Layer | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Conversation | Message history | Immutable Seq[Message] |
| State Management | Agent state | Case classes |
| Tool Registry | Available tools | Type-safe registry |
| Execution Loop | Orchestration | Tail-recursive |

**Code Snippet:**
```scala
case class AgentState(
  conversation: Conversation,
  tools: ToolRegistry,
  status: AgentStatus
)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's peek under the hood at how SZork's game agent works. Every conversation is immutable - we never mutate state. Tools are type-safe and composable. This is functional programming at its finest."

---

## Slide 13: Tool Calling in Action
**Page Layout:** Flow diagram with code examples

**Visual Specification:**
- Step-by-step flow visualization
- Code snippets at each step
- Success/error paths clearly marked
- Type signatures highlighted

**Tool Calling Flow:**
| Step | Action | Code |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Define tool | `ToolFunction[Input, Output]` |
| 2 | Register | `ToolRegistry(Seq(tool))` |
| 3 | LLM decides | `complete(conversation, options)` |
| 4 | Execute | `toolRegistry.execute(request)` |
| 5 | Return result | `ToolMessage(id, result)` |

**Speaker Notes:**
"Agents can call any tool you define. Here's a weather tool - the agent decides when to use it, executes it safely, and incorporates results. Next version of SZork will have inventory management tools!"

---

## Slide 14: Document Processing
**Page Layout:** Pipeline visualization

**Visual Specification:**
- Horizontal pipeline with stages
- Document icon transforming through stages

|-------|----------|--------|
| Load | Read PDF | Raw text |
| Chunk | Split intelligently | Paragraphs |
| Embed | Generate vectors | Embeddings |
| Search | Find relevant | Context |
| Summarize | Generate summary | Final output |

**Performance:**
- 50-page PDF: 3 seconds
- 500-page PDF: 15 seconds
- Accuracy: 95%+

**Speaker Notes:**
"Same agent pattern, different tools. Load a PDF, chunk it intelligently, search it semantically, summarize it. Build your own ChatPDF in Scala - with type safety and performance."

---

## Slide 15: The Power of Scala
**Page Layout:** Comparison table with code examples

**Visual Specification:**
- Two-column comparison: Scala vs Python
- Code examples side by side
- Performance metrics below
- Type safety indicators (checkmarks/X marks)

**Scala Advantages:**
| Feature | Scala | Python |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Type Safety | ✅ Compile-time | ❌ Runtime |
| Immutability | ✅ Default | ⚠️ Optional |
| Concurrency | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ GIL limitations |
| Performance | ✅ JVM speed | ❌ Interpreted |
| Error Handling | ✅ Either/Option | ⚠️ Try/except |

**Code Comparison:**
```scala
// Scala - Caught at compile time
val result: Either[Error, Response] = 
  client.complete(conversation)
```
vs
```python
# Python - Fails at runtime
result = client.complete(conversation)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Why Scala for AI? Type safety catches errors at compile time. Immutability prevents state bugs. True concurrency for parallel API calls. This matters at scale - when you're processing thousands of requests."
