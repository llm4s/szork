| Vector Storage | Similarity search | In-memory/DB |
| Query Processing | Find relevant chunks | Cosine similarity |
| Context Assembly | Build prompts | LLM4S agents |
| Response Generation | Final answer | GPT-4/Claude |

| "What providers are supported?" | Provider list |
| "How does tool calling work?" | Tool API explanation |

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's ask: 'How do I create an agent in LLM4S?' [Run query] Notice it's not just returning generic info - it's finding the exact code examples from our docs. This same pattern works on any knowledge base."

---

## Slide 10: Code Generation Power
**Page Layout:** Code editor view with side panel

**Visual Specification:**
- Main area: Syntax-highlighted Scala code
- Side panel: Generation parameters
- Bottom: Type safety indicators

  name = "get_weather",
  description = "Get current weather",
  parameters = Map(
    "location" -> StringParam(required = true)
  ),
  execute = { params =>
    // AI-generated implementation
    val location = params("location")
    Right(Json.obj(
      "temp" -> 72,
      "condition" -> "sunny"
    ))
  }
)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Watch this - we'll have AI generate a complete Scala tool. Notice the type safety - the AI respects Scala's type system. This isn't just code completion; it's understanding and generating idiomatic Scala."

---

## Slide 11: Image Understanding
**Page Layout:** Before/after comparison

**Visual Specification:**

| Execution Loop | Orchestration | Tail-recursive |

**Code Snippet:**
```scala
case class AgentState(
  conversation: Conversation,
  tools: ToolRegistry,
  status: AgentStatus
)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's peek under the hood at how SZork's game agent works. Every conversation is immutable - we never mutate state. Tools are type-safe and composable. This is functional programming at its finest."

---

## Slide 13: Tool Calling in Action
**Page Layout:** Flow diagram with code examples

**Visual Specification:**
- Step-by-step flow visualization
- Code snippets at each step
- Success/error paths clearly marked

| 2 | Register | `ToolRegistry(Seq(tool))` |
| 3 | LLM decides | `complete(conversation, options)` |
| 4 | Execute | `toolRegistry.execute(request)` |
| 5 | Return result | `ToolMessage(id, result)` |

**Speaker Notes:**
"Agents can call any tool you define. Here's a weather tool - the agent decides when to use it, executes it safely, and incorporates results. Next version of SZork will have inventory management tools!"

| Summarize | Generate summary | Final output |

**Performance:**
- 50-page PDF: 3 seconds
- 500-page PDF: 15 seconds
- Accuracy: 95%+

**Speaker Notes:**
"Same agent pattern, different tools. Load a PDF, chunk it intelligently, search it semantically, summarize it. Build your own ChatPDF in Scala - with type safety and performance."

---

## Slide 15: The Power of Scala
**Page Layout:** Comparison table with code examples

**Visual Specification:**
- Two-column comparison: Scala vs Python
- Code examples side by side
- Performance metrics below
- Type safety indicators (checkmarks/X marks)

**Scala Advantages:**
| Feature | Scala | Python |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Type Safety | ✅ Compile-time | ❌ Runtime |
| Immutability | ✅ Default | ⚠️ Optional |
| Concurrency | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ GIL limitations |
| Performance | ✅ JVM speed | ❌ Interpreted |
| Error Handling | ✅ Either/Option | ⚠️ Try/except |

**Code Comparison:**
```scala
// Scala - Caught at compile time
val result: Either[Error, Response] = 
  client.complete(conversation)
```
vs
```python
# Python - Fails at runtime
result = client.complete(conversation)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Why Scala for AI? Type safety catches errors at compile time. Immutability prevents state bugs. True concurrency for parallel API calls. This matters at scale - when you're processing thousands of requests."
